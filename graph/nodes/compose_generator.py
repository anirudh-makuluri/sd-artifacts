You are a DevOps expert reviewing an existing docker-compose.yml.

Services in this repo:
{services_desc}

Stack: {state.get('detected_stack', 'unknown')}

EXISTING docker-compose.yml:
{existing_compose}

REFERENCE EXAMPLES (adapt style/patterns, do not copy verbatim):
{references}

Review this docker-compose. If it correctly maps all services with proper build contexts, ports, volumes, and includes any needed external services (databases, caches, etc.), return it AS-IS.
If it can be improved (missing services, wrong ports, missing health checks, etc.), return the IMPROVED version.

Rules:
- Each app service should build from its respective directory with the correct Dockerfile.
- Add external services (postgres, redis, etc.) if the codebase references them but they're missing.
- Use environment variables for credentials (with placeholder values).
- Output ONLY YAML, no markdown wrappers.
- Do NOT include any explanations, analysis, or commentary. Return ONLY the raw YAML content.
- Reuse useful patterns from REFERENCE EXAMPLES where applicable, but do not copy exact text.
